So I added interface and type so that they could get arguments other than string.   \r\n<!-- Please provide a description of the change here. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This serialization involves deep introspection of the original function code to determine what needs to be 'captured' and converted into the final code that runs in the cloud.\r\n\r\nOne of our customers wanted to use Pulumi along with the great sequelize library.  However, they ran into a problem due to an inability to serialize out some of the sequelize types due to some quirky stuff your library does.\r\n\r\nSo what happens in sequelize that causes problems here?  Well, in order to serialize a user's function we must `toString` it (getting the original source code from nodejs).  We then analyze the function body, finding out what values have been captured and serializing htem as well.  When we hit other function instances we recurse into them performing the same logic.  In this case the user wanted to serialize `sequelize.UUID`.  However, this fails because `pulumi` is unable to `toString` this function instance.  It's unable to, because in https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/pull/10495 `sequelize` moved over from this being a normal function to a `class` that **also** supplies a **static** `toString` method.  This `toString` then intercepts the call to get the normal `Function.prototype.toString` implementation.\r\n\r\nNormally, we could fix this by just calling `Function.prototype.toString.call(the_user_func)`.  However, that doesn't work here because `sequelize` **also** then wraps the class constructor function in a `Proxy` here: https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/blob/6b3ccd81158d522fb6afe6580e0c751426795b50/lib/data-types.js#L1048-L1052\r\n\r\nBecause the class constructor function is wrapped in a Proxy, it is impossible to get at the underlying target to then pass to `Function.prototype.toString`.   Because of the combination of these two behaviors, it is effectively impossible to now get at the originating source code of this function in order to serialize it to a cloud-function.\r\n\r\nI'm opening this PR up with what is hopefully a very minor and non-contentious change to help support this scenario.  Specifically, this just removes the **static** `toString` method on the class (not the **instance** method).  Looking at the PR that introduced this change, I have a guess that thsi addition was unintentional.  i.e. The previous code that was function-based did not do this https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/pull/10495/files#diff-696825d45557dfe5b68972fd6f69587bL15.  It only overrode the instance `toString` and left the `ABSTRACT` function as something that would `toString` itself using normal JS semantics.  \r\n\r\nI hope this is something you can take.  Thanks much!",

This change alters this behavior to only return the fields defined in the model, provided a model definition is passed.\r\n\r\nNote: this is a breaking change since the option `returning: true` will no longer create\r\nattributes on the instance that are not defined in the model.\r\n\r\nThe old default behavior can be used by:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- returning: true\r\n+ returning: ['*']\r\n```\r\n",

Assuming the fix for this latter issue worked to solve this issue, then a dependency upgrade of `marked` within `esdoc` might solve the problem, but there are [maintenance issues](https://github.com/esdoc/esdoc/pull/543) there preventing updates or merges.\r\n\r\nUntil that point, this is a workaround to avoiding the weird `mailto:` links on this page by using HTML and character encoded entities instead.  Various attempts like `<code>foobar@1.2.3</code>` still rendered in the inner version spec as an email address.\r\n\r\n",

For both those dialects the setIsolationLevel query must be executed before the startTransaction query. For postgres the reverse is required, but it must be set before the first query in the transaction. For other dialects, it can be set at any time before or during a transaction.\r\n\r\nThis drops `SESSION` from the `SET TRANSACTION` queries, in order to set the isolation for a just a single transaction when future transactions in the session don't specify one, and updates MySQL and MariaDB to issue the `SET TRANSACTION` statement before the `START TRANSACTION`.\r\n\r\nThree integration tests are added to confirm that changing isolation level works in all dialects. All added tests fail in mysql and mariadb without this fix.",

For both those dialects the setIsolationLevel query must be executed before the startTransaction query. For postgres the reverse is required, but it must be set before the first query in the transaction. For other dialects, it can be set at any time before or during a transaction.\r\n\r\nThis drops `SESSION` from the `SET TRANSACTION` queries, in order to set the isolation for a just a single transaction when future transactions in the session don't specify one, and updates MySQL and MariaDB to issue the `SET TRANSACTION` statement before the `START TRANSACTION`.\r\n\r\nThree tests are added to confirm that changes isolation level works in all dialects. All added tests fail in mysql and mariadb without this fix.",

For example, if an error is thrown with the message 'invalid input syntax for integer: \"220.00000000000003\"' for a table with multiple integer columns, it is impossible to figure out, from the contents of the error, the exact column in which the query attempted to insert the value. With this change it should be possible to match the the value and the column using the index of the value in the newly added parameter.",

When compiling list of attributes to be included as part of SQL query the initial list is cleaned up from virtual column and then updated with column aliases. Before this change only column aliases worked correctly. Pull request doesn't include new test but there is a change to test/integration/model/scope/find.test.js file that adds a virtual column to `DefaultScopeExclude` model that has scope with `attributes` config already defined.\r\nI think the test case `should work when included with default scope` works to prevent regression here.\r\n",
